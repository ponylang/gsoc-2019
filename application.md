# Why does your org want to participate in Google Summer of Code?

Pony has a small but dedicated community. This makes it an ideal project for students because their contributions will have a large impact. The project will benefit from the work the students do, and the students will be able to point to their work as a major contribution to an open source project. Also students can learn a lot about the compilers, language runtimes, concurrency, type-system etc. by contributing to Pony.

# How many potential mentors have agreed to mentor this year?

Two

# How will you keep mentors engaged with their students?

Students and mentors will meet twice a week on a call to discuss:

* project progress
* any issues that have come up

# How will you help your students stay on schedule to complete their projects?

We will work with the students to come up with a realistic timeline with deliverables at least once a week. We will try to structure the timelines so that the deliverables provide incremental value to the overall project. As we move through the project we will re-evaluate deadlines and deliverables in order to make sure that the timeline remains realistic.

Students and mentors, along with any other relevant members of the Pony community, will meet to review each deliverable. This meeting will serve as a checkpoint to provide specific feedback on the deliverable and determine whether to move on to the next step or to work to improve the deliverable.

# How will you get your students involved in your community during GSoC?

Students will be encouraged to participate in the [Pony Slack Channel](https://ponylang.slack.com), Pony [dev](https://pony.groups.io/g/dev/) and [user](https://pony.groups.io/g/user/) mailing lists, and [Pony IRC channel](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23ponylang). They will also be encouraged to join and participate in the weekly Pony developer sync call, an hour-long call where members of the development team discuss RFCs, issues, and other topics.

# How will you keep students involved with your community after GSoC?

Once students have done work in Pony they should be familiar enough with it to contribute to other efforts. We will continue to involve them in discussions and work with them to help them tackle new projects that come up within Pony.

# Has your org been accepted as a mentor org in Google Summer of Code before?

No.

# What year was your project started?

2013.

# Where does your source code live?
